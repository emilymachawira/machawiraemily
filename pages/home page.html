     <h2>My Profile</h2></center>
     Born on the 26 of March in 1999 is this lady by the name of Emily Munashe Machawira and thats me by the way.I was born in a family of 5 being the first fruit of Mr and Mrs Machawira, followed by other 2 siblings Blessing and Elsa. At first i had hated the ideaa of having 
     siblings because I was afraid of accepting responsibilities but as I grew up I've learnt to be a responsible young woman.I can actually say that I'm glad to be part of this big family.

    I did my primary at Chinhoyi Primary School in Chinhoyi and my 'O' and 'A' Level at Sanyati Baptist High School. It was a tough time moving from primary to secondary school but I learnt to adapt. I came out well in both 'O' and 'A' Level and my results are as follows:

    I later moved on to University and I'm currently studying at Harare Institute of Technogy (HIT). I actually thought that high school was much difficult than university but little did I know that I was heading for danger which I'm supposed to bear for 4 good years. Nevertheless, I'm learning to adapt to the pressure and it is becoming an enjoyment as one wise man once said, "For you to be successful you have to enjoy what you do" and "In life nothing comes easily, you have to work for it and sometimes fail but you will eventually succeed if you don't give up". So here I am trying my best and with the mind to succeed.
