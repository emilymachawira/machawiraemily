 			At University I have met a few friends who have become like family to me, as my favourite quote says, "Life without friends is like a day without sunshine, a garden of beautiful flowers without water and sunlight". My friends bring the best in me and maybe sometimes the beast in me should I say. We often call ourselves names and it is fun because it makes us forget about the pressure at HIT for sometime because HIT needs someone who is able to laugh at themselves to withstand it else one will die of the pressure.

 			I also love cats and I can call them friends lol.
